Using pointers or smart pointers means you're storing a reference to the original object, and not a copy. But remember, if you're using raw pointers, you need to ensure the lifetime of the object being pointed to outlives the pointer. With smart pointers, the memory management is handled for you, but you still need to be aware of ownership and the object's lifetime.
